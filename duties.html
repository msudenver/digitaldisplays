          <p>While the digital display redesign project was my main project, I still had other duties to fulfil during the same time. This is where I learned to really focus on priorities and time management. During my self directed project there were other projects I had to assist on, there were daily things to do such as support and calendar moderation, and other small side projects that could be finished within a few hours or a day.</p>

          <h3>
          <a id="meetings" class="anchor" href="#meetings" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Weekly Meetings</h3>
          <p>During the weekly meetings on Monday mornings at 11 AM, we discussed all the projects, where we were standing, if we needed help, if new projects have come up, who does what, show progress, and check things off of the calendar. These were not only mornings where we would show things, this is also a morning where we self reflect on current events. If things are getting out of hand, others can step in and help.</p>

          <p>Sometimes when you are busy you can be stopped out of nowhere and have to give a hand to one of your colleagues because there is an error in the <code>code</code> that he or she can’t see. Maybe a fresh pair of eyes from someone who didn’t write any of the code you are working on can be key to fixing certain errors. </p>

          <p>Terminal Four is a great tool when you are not a web developer, but when you are, you will most likely find a WCMS to be harder than just writing code. Sometimes it gives you crazy errors and then people will call you to fix it. In the next two images I am updating a table with topics. Little side projects such as these come by daily.</p>

          <p>For the University’s website (<a href="http://www.msudenver.edu" target="_blank">msudenver.edu</a>) we use the calendar database <a href="https://www.trumba.com/connect/features/default.aspx" target="_blank"><code>trumba</code></a> and I was to daily check for submissions from people on campus. Once a new submission came through I had to check it out, make sure it was selected into the right calendar, and publish it.</p>

          <h3>
          <a id="content" class="anchor" href="#content" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Content</h3>
          <p>Usually there is a person who already has content ready for the pages you build, however, sometimes there is not. This leaves only yourself left, and therefore you’re going to be adding content for hours at the time. In the photo underneath I am double checking and adding all the MSU Denver programs to our main website. <a href="http://www.msudenver.edu/programs" target="_blank">You can actually see and interact with it live here.</a></p>
